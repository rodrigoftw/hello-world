# hello-world


Hello to whoever reads this. My name is Rodrigo, but you can call me whatever you like.
I'm learning Git, Javascript and other related stuff, I'm a total noob at the moment with
Web stuff but I hope I can increase my experience real fast with Git. Meh. I don't know
what to say about myself.
